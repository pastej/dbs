My name is Sarab Shihab, I live in Sweden and study Industrial Design at the University of Gävle. I’m finishing my Bachelor’s degree this spring of 2017.

I design everything for the home, with a focus on furniture. My style is clean and simple, I like to combine soft and hard shapes and materials.

I have previously studied two years at the School of Architecture, Lund University. That’s where my interest in design first started growing. Architecture is still a big interest of mine, I hope to incorporate it in my work as an Industrial designer.
