Hi! My name is Sarab Sundin, I am a Designer based in Uppsala, Sweden.

I have a bachelor's degree in Industrial Design from the University of GÃ¤vle.

I have always been interested in psychology and especially human behavior. During my many years in the service profession, I have accumulated a lot of experience of how people work. This is something that has increased my interest in the area even more.

That's why I also chose to take a practical course, in which I work my way through the entire UX design process from research to a finished prototype. The purpose for me has been to gain better insight into UX design and also broaden my knowledge as a designer.

I want to work with both industrial design and UX design and hope to be able to use my knowledge within these areas in my future job.

I am now looking for an internship or junior position in industrial design or UX design. I feel confident that I will quickly be able to contribute a lot if I get the chance.
