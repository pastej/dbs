I made The Chair in a project called "the fantasy project", while I was studying at architecture school in Lund. My inspiration was the Barcelona chair by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

I wanted to create a chair in which I combined soft and hard forms. And I worked with the interaction between form and function, a chair that was aesthetically appealing and yet comfortable to sit in.

Materials: Oak, Aluminum, Synthetic Leather and Foam Rubber.
