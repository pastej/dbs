Ray is a pot with an integrated plant lighting, which helps plants to survive in rooms that don't get enough sunlight. The lamp is height adjustable to suit different types of plants and also gives the plant room to grow.

I created "Ray" as a group project together with Joakim Holmer and Ludwig Löwf at the Industrial Design program in Gävle, Sweden.

The goal of the project was to create a concept for an indoor environment in form of a product that contribute to a better quality of life.

The client of the project was [Greenworks](http://greenwork.se/).

Materials: Oak, concrete, metal and LED lighting.
