Base10 is a co-working center for tech-startups based in Uppsala. For my Industrial Design thesis work I designed a phone booth for them.

The goal of the project was to create a furniture that could be used in the busy open areas for people that needed to take a call or a Skype meeting on-the-go. The result was a sound-absorbant phone booth, designed to fit in with the interior style of the co-working center.

Materials: OSB, metal, polyester (sound absorbant), fabric.
