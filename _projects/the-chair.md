title: The Chair
order: 1
paragraphs:
  - I made The Chair in a project called "the fantasy project", while I was studying at architecture school in Lund.
  - We started the project by creating a fantasy figure, which we then created a house for, and then later a lamp and a chair. I wanted to create a chair in which I combined soft and hard forms. That was aesthetically appealing and yet comfortable to sit in.
  - "Materials: Oak, Aluminum, Synthetic Leather and Foam Rubber."
